Project Title:
Analyzing bike-share data via a python program

Description:
For this project, I wrote a Python code to explore data of a bike share system for the following cities: Washington, New York City and Chicago. The Python code is interactive with the user and allows to analyze the raw data.
With this code you can filter the data by city, month and day and you will receive several statistics:

-The most common month, day and hour
-The most common start station, end station and route
-Travel duration
-Travel time in average
-Count of user
-Information about gender and further information for example, birht year (only available in New York City and and Chicago)

Files:
I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States.
To run the Python code you need to following files:
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

The three files contain data of the first six month of the year 2017.
